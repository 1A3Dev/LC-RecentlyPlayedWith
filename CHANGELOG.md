### 1.0.3

- Made players be force added to the list when the lever to land is pulled.
  - This is mainly to ensure that players that are in the lobby for a long time don't disappear if a lot of people join & leave during the same session (since steam only shows the last 100 recent players).
- Made players be re-added to the list if they leave & re-join the lobby.
- Made the configuration option to include people in orbit default to true.
- Updated README.md to mention v47-v49 support.

### 1.0.2

- Updated README.md

### 1.0.1

- Made steam ids be bulk logged rather than one log per steam id.

### 1.0.0

- Initial Release
