# RecentlyPlayedWith

## Information

Ever joined a public lobby and found someone that seems cool but ended up forgetting to friend them or crashed before you could?

This mod enables the steam "recently played with" integration which allows you to view the list of people you have recently played with. You can access the list by opening steam then clicking View > Players (https://i.imgur.com/Mzdrgjt.png).

Note: By default people are only added when the ship lands on a planet (to prevent the list being cluttered with people who leave before the game starts) however this can be changed in the config.

## Changelog

### 1.0.1

- Made steam ids be bulk logged rather than one log per steam id.
